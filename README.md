# analysis of MEA data from a drug perfusion experiment
matlab scripts for parsing and analyzing multi-electrode data

We recorded the spontaneous activity of a network of neurons cultured on a multi-electrode array (MEA) and then slowly washed in different kinds of drugs to determine whether their presence alters the spontaneous activity of the neuronal culture. The data was initially recorded from the MEA2100 system on MCRack (MultiChannel systems) in 120 or 240 second increments (thus splitting a single 480s recording into 2 or 4 separate files). We then converted the raw data into .txt files using MCDataTool. This package takes the data from those .txt files and parses it using `import_txt`, then merges the consecutive recordings back together using `merge_imported_data`. Then, `detect_spike_rates` finds where neuron spikes occurred based on user defined thresholds and measures the instantaneous spike rate (Hz) of each recorded neuron over the course of the experiment, depositing the results into the sctructure `electrode_traces`.

A subsequent script, `rate_smooth_and_norm` takes spike rate data generated by `perfusion_parser` and smooths, re-bins, and normalizes it to the mean baseline spike rate within the first 100s of the original recording to facilitate subsequent plotting.
  
### Running the package

All function calls are made within the script `perfusion_parser`. All you need to do is download the sample data sets `CNQX_perfusion` and `CNQX_perfusion0001` and set the directory where these two files are located and the directory where you would like the program to send its output files.
```
fpath = '/users/abubnys/Desktop/'; % location of the .txt data
outpt_path = '/users/abubnys/Desktop/'; % location to put outputs
```

`perfusion_parser` will produce 3 kinds of files:
1. `onoms`: parsed versions of each .txt file
2. `merge_nom`: a file that merges all of the data from separate .txt files together 
3. `output_name`: the file and directory where the final output will go

### The output

output structure, `electrode_traces` contains the following fields:
1. `electrode`: the name of the electrode
2. `data`: raw data from that electrode
3. `spike times`: time (s) when each detected spike happened, this will be a double if only one neuron was detected on the traces, or a cell array with the number of cells equal to the number of neurons detected in the recording
4. `spike amplitudes`: maximum amplitude (uV) of each spike, organized in the same manner as spike times
5. `spk_thresh`: threshold for spike detection. If only one neuron was detected this is a single value and all periods during which the raw trace dropped below this value count as a spike. If multiple neurons were detected, this is an n-by-4 vector in which each row corresponds to the set of thresholds for a given neuron. Columns 1 and 2 are the x and y values for the upper threshold, and columnes 3 and 4 are the x and y values for the lower threshold. A spike for a given neuron is registered if the raw trace intersects with the line defined by these two coordinates.
6. `spike rates`: the binned spike rate (Hz) for each recorded neuron. Each bin corresponds to the instantaneous spike rate over 100 ms. 

### User inputs

`detect_spike_rates` prompts the user to input decisions and information about spike thresholds at various points throughout the run. This function will iterate through the data for each electrode and determine spike rates from there. A more detailed description of these prompts follows:

First, it will take the 480s of raw data for that electrode and plot it across 4 rows of a figure:

![example of raw electrode data](/e52.png)

The program them prompts the user to identify whether the given raw data contains any spiking activity
```
spiking? (y=1)
```
If there is no apparent activity on this recording, the user selects option 0 and the program continues on to the next recording. However, in this case we observe that there is spiking activity happening in the recording, so we select option 1. 

The program then prompts the user to identify a period within the recording in which said activity is happening.
```
pick a spiking period
```
Because the full recording is so long and therefore the individual spikes may be difficult to distinguish, this allows the program to zoom into a selected 10 second window of representative activity. Here we selected 160s as the start of the representative activity period. So, the program generates a new figure which just shows this time window.


![10 second spiking period](/e52_pre_thresh.png)

Now, the program prompts the user to select a threshold for spikes. This is a simple threshold, so all periods when the recording drops below this number will be counted as spikes.
```
threshold? 
```
We set the threshold to -16 in order to capture the spikes without picking up too much noise.

Now, the program draws a red line where the threshold has been set and prompts the user to say whether this is a suitable threshold.

![simple threshold](/e52_thresh.png)

```
good threshold? (y=1)
```
We are happy with the current threshold, so we selection option 1. However, if the initial threshold setting is too high or too low, you can select option 0 and the program will prompt the user to select a new threshold as before and the process will continue ad inifintum until a suitable threshold is selected.

Now the program takes the spikes it detected within that 10 second time window with the given threshold and plots all of their waveforms in an overlay.

![wavelets](/e52_wavelet.png)

All of the wavelets converge on a single curve in this case, so the spiking activity in this recording is only coming from a single neuron somewhere in the vicinity.
```
multiple neurons? (y=1, n=0)
```
Thus, we select option 0 and the program continues with the analysis to generate a final figure which includes the raw data plot, a raster plot of identified spikes, and a plot of the binned spike rate (calculated from 100ms bins).

### An example with multiple neurons
      
Sometimes, an extracellular electrode can pick up signal from multiple nearby neurons. Since signal amplitude is related to distance from the electrode, usually this is quite apparent as some spikes as consistently smaller than others.

![a trace with 2 neurons](/e78.png)

![closeup of trace](/e78_thresh.png)

We select a threshold of -15 to include both the small and the large spikes. And now the waveforms look like this.

![waveforms](/wavelets.png)

Unlike in the previous case, there now appear to be two types of waveforms. A low amplitude waveform, which includes many more spikes, and a high amplitude waveform, which has a smaller membership.
```
multiple neurons? (y=1,n=0)
```
This time, we select option 1 since we need to separate the spikes that are coming from the two different neurons. The program deals with this issue by setting up positive and negative thresholds within the spike waveforms such that only waveforms that cross the line defined by these thresholds are registered to a given neuron. 
```
select upper threshold, then return
```
First, we would like to separate the large amplitude spikes. So, we bring the data cursor over the waveform plot and select the upper bound for this group.

![threshold 1](/wavelets_t1.png)

```
select lower threshold, then return
```
Now, we do the same for the lower threshold.

![threshold 2](/wavelets_t2.png)

After we press return on the second threshold, the program draws the threshold line we have created and colors all of the waveforms that cross that threshold and are therefore registered to that neuron. 

![cell 1](/wavelets_cell1.png)

```
good threshold? (y=1,n=0)
```
The user now has the option to reset these thresholds if they are unhappy with the outcome. However, we will leave them as they are by selecting option 1.
```
find another cell? (y=1, n=0)
```
Now, we have the option of setting the thresholds for a second neuron. So, we select option 1 and repeat the same process of selecting upper and lower thresholds for the second "low amplitude" neuron. The waveforms registered to cell 2 are colored in green.

![cell 2](/wavelets_cell2.png)

```
find another cell? (y=1, n=0)
```
There are only two neurons recorded by this electrode, so we select option 0. Now the program does some crunching and comes up with the final output:

![output for 2 neurons](/e78_final.png)

The setup is the same as in the first example, but now the raster plot and spike rate plot show spikes registered to two different neurons.

### Smoothing and normalizing spike rates

The additional script `rate_smooth_and_norm` takes the 100ms binned spike rates generated by `perfusion_parser` and further smooths and normalizes them. This script is run using the data saved to the file specified in `output_name`. Here we have already loaded a test set called `SampleData_spikes` that's located in the folder specified by the variable `fpath`.
```
load([fpath 'SampleData_spikes.mat'])
```
